# Los-Angeles-Crime-Data-Analysis

Los Angeles has a complicated terrain of criminal activity, which calls for a sophisticated knowledge of crime patterns, trends, and contributing factors. This project uses a complete dataset provided by the LAPD to analyze crime trends in Los Angeles from 2020 to March 1st, 2024. The dataset includes several important attributes, such as the location coordinates, victim demographics (age, sex, and descent), crime code description, victim demographics recorded, date of occurrence, time of occurrence, and geographic area. This project intends to find patterns, correlations, and insights in the data using sophisticated analytical techniques and visualization tools, providing useful information to support law enforcement agencies, lawmakers, and community stakeholders in their efforts to prevent and mitigate crime. Ultimately, the findings of this analysis can inform evidence-based decision-making processes and contribute to fostering safer communities in Los Angeles.
